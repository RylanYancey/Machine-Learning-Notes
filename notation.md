## Set Notation

Set: "unordered collection of unique elements"
```
set = { 50, 1.4, 9903, 332 }
```
Sets are denoted as { e1, ..., en } with curly brackets. 

Set Belonging is denoted with an Epsilon:\

The special set R denotes a set of all numbers -inf to +inf.

[a, b] set from a to b, inclusive.
(a, b) set from a to b, exclusive.
\[a, b) set from a (inclusive) to b (exclusive)

Set Unions are denoted with " U " and perform like this:
```
{ 1, 5, 8, 3 } U { 3, 2, 4, 8, 1 } = { 1, 5, 8, 3, 2 }
```
The resulting set is every element that exists in both sets (with no repetitions)

Set Intersections are denoted with upside down " U " and perform like this:
```
{ 1, 5, 8 } upside down U { 8, 5, 3, 4 } = { 1, 3, 4 }
```
The result is every element that does not exist in both sets.
